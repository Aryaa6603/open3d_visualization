Because Open3D on local systems nearly kills the system, have fun here :D

# Open3D Visualization in Colab

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook for visualizing point clouds using Open3D. Open3D is a powerful library for 3D data processing, but running it locally might be resource-intensive. This Colab notebook allows you to enjoy Open3D's point cloud visualization in a cloud environment without taxing your local system.

## Usage

1. Open the Colab notebook (`open3d_demo.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and visualize point cloud data using Open3D.
3. Interact with the visualization directly within the Colab environment.

## Note

Running resource-intensive tasks like Open3D on local systems may strain the system resources. Utilizing Colab for such tasks can provide a smoother experience.

Feel free to experiment with Open3D's visualization capabilities in the Colab notebook.
